# TypeScriptCrashCourse
A study into Front End Dev with Typescript

Usefullness of typescript:
    Strongly-typed at design time

    Transpiling(source-to-source compilers): advanced ECMAScript features compatible to all browsers polyfill. Combines other static checkers with Babel.

    Static Typing: Catches potential issues earlier in development. It reduces unit tests, can runtime errors at design time.

    A mature opensource codebase!  
    
    Massively adopted by many companies

    Led by Anders Hejlsberg, creator of C#, Delphi, Turbo Pascal

    leverages libraries and frameworks known by client-side developers: Jquery, MomentJS, BootStrapJS, React etc

    Uses NPM, insasmuch access to millions of libraries 

    TypeScript can run against existing JavaScript code and even provide inference

    Refactoring code is easy, links in the IDE make navigation, adding, removeing, modifying parameters fast

    maintainance is as easy as looking at the type, clicking on it, and seeing the definition

    definition file allows internal documentation for existing javascript libraries

    Intellisense allows for excellent code-completion

    Unit tests limited to testing logic and alogrithms

    pitfalls exposed at development time
